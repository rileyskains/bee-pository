Though the honey bee is native to Europe, western Asia, and Africa, they are found all over the world. Honey bees exist on every continent except for Antarctica, because it is too cold with too few resources for them to survive.

This species, _Apis mellifera_, is commonly referred to as 'honey bee', but they are also frequently called 'Western honey bee' and 'European honey bee'.

Honey bees were one of the first species to be domesticated by humans, almost 10,000 years ago! Pottery was used for beekeeping in Africa about 9,000 years ago, and depictions of beekeeping are also present in Egyption art from nearly 4,500 years ago. Some jars of honey were even found in the tomb of Egyptian pharoah, Tutankhamun!

## Habitat

Honey bees are perfectly happy to live anywhere with an adequate supply of resources. They require a large amount of flowering plants, water, and shelter. Honey bees also prefer to create their hives in a space like a hollow tree or other cavity.

Meadows, forests, gardens, wetlands, grasslands, and even deserts can all support honey bee life so long as sufficient resources are available.

## Bees in the Hive

There are three different types of honey bees in a hive. The Queen, Workers, and Drones. Each one is a different size, has a different lifespan, and has a different set of jobs inside and outside of the hive.

### Sizing (length)

| Queen | Worker | Drone |
|:-----:|:------:|:-----:|
| 18-20 mm | 10-15 mm | 15-17mm |

### Lifespans

| Queen | Worker | Drone |

| 2-3 years | 2-3 weeks | 4-8 weeks |

### The Queen

There is usually only one queen in a hive. The queen is the only bee that is able to lay eggs, and the survival of the bee colony is dependent on her survival and reproductive ability.

The queen will lay eggs almost every day throughout the year, except for exceptionally cold days. Some queens are able to lay about 1,000 eggs every day, making that about 200,000 eggs over the course of her life.

As the queen lays eggs, she is able to decide which eggs will be fertilized and which will not. The eggs that are fertilized will develop as females, making them either worker bees or new queens (this is dependent on how they are fed, which we will look at later). Eggs that are not fertilized will be male, making them drones.

### The Workers

The worker bees are all female. They take care of just about everything in the hive, from food gathering to caring for the developing bees.

### The Drones
